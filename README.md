Cyber Practicals are our labs in my CPEG694 masters course where we either
examine real world scenarios in topics of:
Virtual Systems,
Hardening OS,
Network / port/ vulnerability scanning,
Service Hardening,
Logs and auditing,
as well as a multitude of other topics like using splunk and Snort.

I will try to include the premise of the practicals
after the due date to keep a record.
